I turned 31 on the highest peak of Luzon.

Some people celebrate birthdays in restaurants.
I chose thin air and silence.

## Why Mt. Pulag?

Because I needed distance.
From noise.
From confusion.
From everything that wasn’t aligned.

And somewhere above the clouds,
I decided to finally open this blog.
